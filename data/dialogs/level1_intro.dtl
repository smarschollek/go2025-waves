Well then—welcome to your very first... let's call it [i]real-time introductory seminar[/i]. It sounds important, but it's basically just survival training. For one minute.\
We can do that, right? ...Hopefully."
Before we begin, here is a quick overview of our high-quality operating resources. And yes, that is what it says in the manual.
[signal arg="showCoinPurse"]
That thing there—the coin purse. Your new best friend.\
It collects coins whenever it feels like it. And you need those things to buy units. So treat it well... or at least better than HR.
[signal arg="showDefender"]
Here we have the defender. Robust, dutiful, doesn't talk much — I like him.\
Put him at the front so he can intercept all the unfriendly guests who want to visit us today.
[signal arg="showWizard"]
And that's our trusty wizard. A bit eccentric, but reliable.\
Shoots magic projectiles, deals damage, but can't take any. Typical specialist problem.
Remember, Doug\: no coins, no units. No units... well, you know...
